## Theory and Concepts

Explore the foundational theories and core concepts of deep learning. The relevant materials are located in the [book](https://github.com/merugu/deep-learning-using-tensorflow/tree/main/book) directory.

## Gemstone Price Prediction

In this project, I developed a model to predict gemstone prices based on two features. The implementation can be found in the [work-1](https://github.com/merugu/deep-learning-using-tensorflow/tree/main/tensorflow-keras/work-1) directory.

## House Price Prediction

This section demonstrates the use of the Sequential model from Keras for predicting house prices. I employed multiple dense layers, dropout layers, and validation techniques to enhance model performance. Check out the details in the [work-2](https://github.com/merugu/deep-learning-using-tensorflow/tree/main/tensorflow-keras/work-2) directory.

## Loan Approval Prediction

In this project, I built a model to predict loan approvals using various features. The implementation is available in the [work-4](https://github.com/merugu/deep-learning-using-tensorflow/tree/main/tensorflow-keras/work-4-loan-approval-predictions) directory.

## Classification Metrics and Techniques

This section focuses on classification tasks, where I implemented early stopping and dropout layers to optimize model training. I also explored confusion metrics to evaluate the model's performance. Find the code and details in the [work-3](https://github.com/merugu/deep-learning-using-tensorflow/blob/main/tensorflow-keras/work-3(early-stopping-and-dropout-layer)) directory.
